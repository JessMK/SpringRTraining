# Week 3: Loops, Conditional Statements, and Functions Assignment


# Exercise 1: For Loops

# Write a for loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10.

# Create a vector of numbers c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10). Write a for loop to multiply each number by 3 and print the result.


# Exercise 2: While Loops

# Write a while loop that keeps printing a number starting from 5, subtracting 1 each time until the number reaches 0.

# Modify the loop to break when the number reaches 2.


# Exercise 3: Conditional Statements

# Create a variable x <- 15.

# Write an if statement to print "x is greater than 10" if the condition holds.

# Expand it to an if-else statement to handle the case when x <= 10.

# Use an ifelse() function on a vector c(3, 7, 12, 18, 5) to return "Pass" for elements greater than 10 and "Fail" otherwise.


# Exercise 4: Creating Functions

# Write a function square_num() that takes a number as input and returns its square.

# Test your function on the numbers 4, 7, and 9.

# Write a more complex function that takes two arguments x and y, adds them together, and multiplies by 5.


# Exercise 5: Apply Functions

# Create a matrix matrix_1 <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3).

# Use apply() to calculate the sum of each row.

# Use lapply() on a list containing 1:3, 4:6, and 7:9 to find the mean of each element.


# Show & Tell Bonus: Try Something New

# Explore a new topic related to loops, conditionals, or functions in R.

# Share your R code and explain what you discovered.
# Why did you found it useful.
