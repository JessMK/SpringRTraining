# Week 1: R Basics and Matrices Assignment


# Exercise 1: Arithmetic Operations

# Perform the following arithmetic calculations in R:
  
# Add 125 and 375

# Subtract 47 from 289

# Divide 750 by 15

# Compute the remainder when 17 is divided by 5

# Solve this expression: (10 + 20) * (15 - 5) / (2^3)


# Exercise 2: Variables and Vector Operations

# Assign 100 to a variable x and 50 to a variable y.

# Create a numeric vector from 1 to 10.

# Add 5 to every element of the vector.

# Multiply each element by 3.

# Extract the elements in the 3rd to 7th positions of the vector.


# Exercise 3: Comparison Operations

# Create a vector of numbers c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10).

# Write an expression that checks which elements are greater than 5.

# Write an expression that checks which elements are less than or equal to 4.


# Exercise 4: Matrix Creation and Operations

# Create a 3x3 matrix using numbers from 1 to 9.

# Add 10 to every element of the matrix.

# Compute the row sums and column sums of the matrix.

# Extract the element in the 2nd row and 3rd column.

# Select the entire 1st column of the matrix.


# Exercise 5: Factor Matrices

# Create a vector c(\"High\", \"Medium\", \"Low\", \"High\", \"Low\").

# Convert it to a factor and display the levels.

# Create a 2x3 factor matrix using the vector.

# Explain what happens when factors are printed.


# Show & Tell Bonus: Try Something New

# Think about what you learned this week. 
# Explore a new topic or function related to vectors or matrices.

# Share the R code and explain what you discovered.

# Why did you found it interesting or useful?
