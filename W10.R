# Week 10: Introduction to ggplot2 for Data Visualization

# This week focuses on creating simple and meaningful visualizations 
# with the ggplot2 package. Students will learn about aesthetics, 
# geometries, themes, and how to add custom elements to plots.
# 
# Exercise 1: Creating Your First ggplot

# Load the iris dataset.

# Create a scatter plot of Sepal.Length vs Sepal.Width.

# Set the color of points to represent the Species variable.


# Exercise 2: Exploring Geometries

# Using ggplot2, create a histogram of Petal.Length.

# Set the bins argument to 20.

# Customize the fill color to "skyblue" and add a title to the plot.


# Exercise 3: Faceting by Species

# Create a scatter plot of Petal.Length vs Petal.Width.

# Facet the plot by Species using facet_wrap().

# Set the point color to Species.


# Exercise 4: Adding Custom Themes

# Recreate the scatter plot from Exercise 1.

# Apply the theme_minimal() theme.

# Add custom axis labels, a plot title, and set the legend title to "Flower Type."


# Exercise 5: Combining Layers

# Create a plot showing both a scatter plot and a linear regression line for Sepal.Length vs Sepal.Width.

# Use geom_point() for points and geom_smooth() with method lm for the line.

# Color points by Species.


# Show & Tell: Try Something New
# Explore a ggplot2 function not covered here or customize your plot further. Share your findings and de34monstrate how you applied it to visualize data differently.
