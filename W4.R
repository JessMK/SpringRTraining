# Week 4: Importing and Cleaning Data Assignment


# Exercise 1: Reading Data into R

# Download the built-in mtcars dataset as a CSV file using write.csv().

# Read it back into R using read.csv() and assign it to cars_data.

# Check the structure of the dataset using str() and summarize the dataset using summary().


# Exercise 2: Data Cleaning Basics

# Create a new dataset by modifying cars_data:

# Replace all NA values in the dataset (if any) with 0.

# Convert the mpg column to a factor and observe what happens.

# Remove the carb column from the dataset.

# Rename the column hp to horsepower.


# Exercise 3: Filtering and Selecting Data

# Extract rows where mpg > 20.

# Select only the columns mpg, hp, and wt.

# Arrange the dataset in descending order by mpg.


# Exercise 4: Handling Missing Data

# Add 3 random NA values to the wt column.

# Remove rows containing NA values from the dataset.

# Use na.omit() to clean the dataset and check its structure.


# Exercise 5: Exploring Data with Basic Visualizations

# Create a histogram of the mpg column.

# Plot a scatterplot between mpg and wt.

# Color the scatterplot points by gear.


# Show & Tell Bonus: Try Something New
# Explore a new data cleaning or visualization function in R and share your code.
# What did you learn, and how could it be useful for your future work?
