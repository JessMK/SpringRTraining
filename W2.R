# Week 2: Data Types & Structures Assignment 


# Exercise 1: Understanding Data Types

# Create a numeric variable x with the value 12.5.

# Create a character variable y with the value "R is fun!".

# Check the data types of x and y using class().

# Convert x to a character and y to a factor.


# Exercise 2: Creating and Manipulating Lists

# Create a list containing:

## A numeric vector from 1 to 5

## A character vector with your favorite colors

## A logical vector c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)

# Extract the second element of the list.

# Extract the third element and check its type.


# Exercise 3: Working with Data Frames

# Create a data frame with three columns: Name, Age, and Score. Include five rows with sample data.

# Extract the Name and Score columns using indexing.

# Filter rows where Score > 80.


# Exercise 4: Factors

# Create a factor variable representing c("Low", "Medium", "High", "Low", "High").

# Check the levels of the factor.

# Reorder the levels to High > Medium > Low.


# Exercise 5: Coercion Rules

# Create a vector c(1, "R", TRUE).

# Check the resulting type.

# Explain why coercion happens in this case.


# Show & Tell Bonus: Try Something New

# Explore a new topic or R function related to lists, data frames, or factors.

# Share your R code and explain what you discovered.
# Why did you find it interesting or useful.
